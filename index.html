        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political ScienceðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Isabel Carreon Morales, and I am a student at the University of California, Riverside as a Political Science Student on a pre-law track. A few extra-curricular activities I am  involved in are Model United Nations, Phi Alpha Delta, and National Residence Hall Honorary which have helped me develop and reinforce my public speech and leadership skills. A little about the organizations I am in are that Model United Nations is an organization that mocks the real United Nations and assigns countries to its members and the members represent and speak to the delegates on behalf of their assigned country. This has helped me develop public speaking, articulate speech, and informs me other countries doings. Phi Alpha Delta is a professional Law Fraternity, whose mission is to aid students on a pre-law track, by providing people in the field to come and visit and talk to us, taking us out for field trips, and providing studying resources. Lastly, the National Residence Hall Honorary, is an organization at the UCR campus apartments and at the dormitories who seeks to provide fun, inclusion, and many catered programs to resident interests and needs.<br><br>

        As of right now, I am preparing to become an immigration attorney. I am doing this by participating in an internship this summer (2023) with an immigration attorney. Where I will get to experience a one-on-one with a licensed immigration attorney and learn what they do on their day-to-day basis at their law firm. I will get to review cases, learn immigration terms, stay updated in immigration changes, and see what clients go through their unique cases.<br><br>

        The development of my passion towards this career field (Immigration Law) was deeply rooted in my personal experience. My family and I went through an ardous and expensive process of migrating to the United States. This journey was rife with challenges, and we faced emotional and financial barriers every step of the way. However, during this process, I noticed the attorney who helped us with our case was extremely skilled in his profession. He was articulate and confident, and his office was a testament to his professionalism. I was impressed by his demeanor and how he represented us. As i was going through this process, I was acutely aware of the implications of my case. It was crucial for me to stay in the country to pursue my education, and I was constantly concerned about the outcome of my case. However, with the help of the attorney, we were able to overcome these obstacles and achieve success. After our case was resolved, I began reflecting on the journey that we had been through. I felt deeply grateful for the support that we had recieved and was inspired to make a difference in the lives of others who might be going through similar struggles. This is when I realized that I wanted to become an immigration attorney myself. I was motivated to use my experience and knowledge to help other navigate the immigration system and to make the process easier for them. I want to be a source of support and guidance for those who may be facing emotional and financial barriers as they pursue their dreams. In conclusion, my passion for Immigration Law stems from my personal experience of overcoming the challenges of the immigration process. Seeing the impact that a skilled attorney can have on people's lives and the importance of their work inspired me to pursue this career field. I am now commited to using my skills and experience to help others overcome the obstacles they may face in their immigration journey.
